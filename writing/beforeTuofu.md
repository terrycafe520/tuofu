#### I agree that It is more important to keep your old friends than it is to make new friends.There are following 3 reasons  to surport my oppinion.

*  First, the key point is that how  the man become your old friends. For example ,  we all have  a  good memory with
the classmates in primary or college , We cared about each other,
  laughed and cried in the past school  time . We've known each other for a long time .
   The more time we spend  in a place , the more  we cared more about there.
   So contacting with old friends is more important .


*  Secondly,   new friends will become old friends .
 I do not  say that  we should not make new friends.
  We make new friends in new circumstances in our following life time.
   But how well we can know each other depends on the time we talk with other
   and the things we do together. This is a natural progress .
   If an old friend tells me that he will have a surgery in hosipital ,
   I think all of us will choose to  company with him rather than make new friends in a party.
   When the new friends  became old friends , we will do that choice again ,
   because  we  cared more about the friends we connected for longer time.


*  Lastly, it is good for our health to keep our old friends.
The solid relationship is the key to happiness.
Making new friends only begins the relationship . Howerver,
keeping relationship is a lifetime subject and needs more time  .
 When we had bad time , we will want to find the person who is more comfortable
 and who know you much more. Once we have a good relationship with our old friends ,
  we will be  happy in the rest of our life time.



####  Making new friends begins the relationship ,but keeping the relationship is  more important and it will be  good for us in a long time.
