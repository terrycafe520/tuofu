#### I agree that It is more important to keep your old friends than it is to make new friends.There are following3 reasons surport my oppinion.

*  First, how can the man become your old friends is the key point . The classmates in primary or college ,
 we all have  a  good memory with them . We cared about each other,
  laughed and cried in the past school  time . We known each other for a long time .
   The more time we had spent in somewhere , where is we cared more about .
   So you connected with old friends is more important .


*  Secondly,   new friends will become old friends .
 I do not  say that  we should not make new friends.
  We make new friends in new circumstances in our following life time.
   But we know each other very well depends on the time we talked with other
   and the things we done together. This is a natural progress .
   If the old friends tell me that he will have a surgery in hosipital ,
   I think all of us will choose company with him other than make new friends in a party.
   When the new friends  became old friends , we will do that choice again ,
   because  we more cared about the friends we connected  long time.


*  Lastly, keep our old friends is good for our health .
The solid relationship is the key to happiness.
Making new friends only begins the relationship ,
keeping relationship is a lifetime subject and needs more time  .
 When we had bad time , we will want to find who is more comfortable
 and who known you much more. Once we have a good relationship with old friends ,
  we are happy in the rest life time.



####  Making new friends begins the relationship ,but keep the relationship is  more important and will good for us in a long time.
